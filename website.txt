Suggested Improvements

1. Cover Page Enhancement

The header currently uses a background image with text overlay, but we could make it more dynamic and attractive with a slideshow showcasing water bodies.

2. Content Structure Improvements

The "About" section appears to be positioned incorrectly (after the gallery)

Missing a dedicated "Research" section to highlight Dr. Rathore's work

Articles section needs more structure and depth

3. Technical Improvements

Add loading animations for better user experience

Implement form submission functionality

Optimize images for faster loading

Add proper SEO meta tags
